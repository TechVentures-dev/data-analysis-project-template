# Data Analysis Project Checklist

## Project Setup
- [ ] Create a GitHub repository
- [ ] Clone the GitHub repository locally
- [ ] Open the project in an editor (e.g., VS Code)
- [ ] Create a `.gitignore` file (include common Python, Jupyter, and OS-specific files)
- [ ] Set up a virtual environment (e.g., using `venv` or `conda`)
- [ ] Create a `requirements.txt` file for project dependencies

## Project Documentation
- [ ] Create a project README.md
  - [ ] Describe the project idea and objectives
  - [ ] List data source(s)
  - [ ] Outline possible outcomes or questions to explore
  - [ ] Include setup instructions for other users

## Data Acquisition and Storage
- [ ] Create a `data/` directory in the project folder
- [ ] Download or access the required dataset(s)
- [ ] Document the data source and acquisition date
- [ ] If applicable, create a data dictionary explaining the dataset's structure

## Initial Data Exploration
- [ ] Create a Jupyter notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- [ ] Load and inspect the data
- [ ] Check for missing values, duplicates, and data types
- [ ] Perform basic statistical analysis
- [ ] Create initial visualizations to understand data distribution and relationships

## Data Preprocessing
- [ ] Handle missing values
- [ ] Address outliers if necessary
- [ ] Perform feature engineering if required
- [ ] Normalize or standardize data if needed
- [ ] Encode categorical variables if applicable

## In-depth Analysis
- [ ] Formulate specific questions or hypotheses
- [ ] Conduct statistical tests if applicable
- [ ] Apply machine learning models if part of the project scope
- [ ] Validate results and check for overfitting if using ML models

## Data Visualization
- [ ] Create more detailed and polished visualizations
- [ ] Ensure visualizations are clear, labeled, and tell a story
- [ ] Consider interactive visualizations if appropriate

## Dashboard Creation
- [ ] Plan dashboard layout and components
- [ ] Prepare a dashboard using a library like Plotly Dash
- [ ] Ensure the dashboard is interactive and user-friendly
- [ ] Test the dashboard with sample users if possible

## Code Quality and Documentation
- [ ] Refactor code for clarity and efficiency
- [ ] Add comments to explain complex operations
- [ ] Create functions or classes for reusable code
- [ ] Ensure consistent coding style (consider using a linter)

## Project Delivery
- [ ] Prepare a final report or presentation
- [ ] Summarize key findings and insights
- [ ] Discuss limitations and potential future work

## Version Control and Collaboration
- [ ] Commit changes regularly with clear, descriptive messages
- [ ] Create a development branch for major changes
- [ ] Open pull requests for significant features or changes
- [ ] Review and merge pull requests
- [ ] Tag releases for major project milestones

## Continuous Improvement
- [ ] Open GitHub issues for areas of improvement
- [ ] Create a project board to track tasks and progress
- [ ] Seek feedback from peers or mentors
- [ ] Update the project based on feedback and new insights

## Deployment (if applicable)
- [ ] Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, GCP)
- [ ] Set up necessary accounts and permissions
- [ ] Configure the deployment environment
- [ ] Deploy the project (dashboard, API, etc.)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging

## Maintenance
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies
- [ ] Address any reported issues or bugs
- [ ] Periodically review and update documentation
