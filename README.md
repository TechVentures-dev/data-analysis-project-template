# Data Analysis Project Template

This template provides a standardized structure for data analysis projects. It includes directories for data, notebooks, source code, tests, and a comprehensive checklist to guide you through the project lifecycle.

See the [Data Analysis Project Checklist](docs/CHECKLIST.md) for a more complete overview of the repeatable data analysis project process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- git

### Setting up the project

1. Use this template to create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your new repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
   cd your-project-name
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Checklist

- [ ] Fork the Data Analysis Project Template GitHub repository
- [ ] Clone the forked GitHub repository
- [ ] Open the project in an editor (e.g., VS Code)
- [ ] Update the README.md with your project details
- [ ] Set up a virtual environment
- [ ] Install required dependencies
- [ ] Add your data source to the `data/` directory
- [ ] Create a Jupyter notebook for initial exploration (EDA) in the `notebooks/` directory
- [ ] Explore and visualize the data
- [ ] Implement data preprocessing in `src/data_preprocessing.py`
- [ ] Create visualizations using `src/visualization.py`
- [ ] Prepare a dashboard using a library like Plotly Dash using `src/app.py`
- [ ] Write tests in the `tests/` directory
- [ ] Commit all code to GitHub
- [ ] Open GitHub issues for areas of improvement

## Common Workflows

### Running Jupyter Notebooks

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
2. Start Jupyter Lab:
   ```
   jupyter lab
   ```
3. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open or create notebooks as needed.

### Adding New Dependencies

1. Add the package to `requirements.txt`.
2. Install the new package:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running Tests

1. Ensure you're in the project root directory.
2. Run tests using pytest:
   ```
   pytest tests/
   ```

### Committing Changes

1. Stage your changes:
   ```
   git add .
   ```
2. Commit your changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   ```
3. Push to GitHub:
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

## Project Lifecycle

1. **Data Collection**: Add your dataset to the `data/` directory and update the README with information about your data source.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Use the notebook in `notebooks/01_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` to perform initial data exploration.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Implement data cleaning and preprocessing functions in `src/data_preprocessing.py`.
4. **Visualization**: Create functions for generating visualizations in `src/visualization.py`.
5. **Analysis**: Conduct your main analysis in Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts as appropriate.
6. **Dashboard Creation**: If applicable, create a dashboard using a library like Plotly Dash.
7. **Documentation**: Keep this README updated with project progress, findings, and instructions for running your analysis.
8. **Testing**: Write tests for your functions in the `tests/` directory.
9. **Version Control**: Regularly commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
10. **Continuous Improvement**: Use GitHub Issues to track areas for improvement or future work.
